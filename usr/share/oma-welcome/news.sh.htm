			<h1 class="titlePage">Kernel 3.11.8 NRJ-QL</h1>
			<p>
			OpenMandriva Lx features new kernel called <span class="username">NRJ</span> as for energy!. With the "NRJ" configs the CPU and RCU are configured with full Pre-emption enabled and in full Boost mode, while the "QL" mode adds the CK1 and BFQ patchsets which combine to provide further optimisations, including better CPU load scheduling (BFS) and improved disk I/O scheduling (BFQ), Improved memory managment is present with the provision of UKSM and TOI for better suspension and hibernate functionality, each designed with desktop system performance and responsiveness in mind. Some very recent USB patches that partially correct a misinterpretation of the USB standard will improve device compatibility and also ensure that devices re-awake properly after suspend or hibernate. NFS has also received some attention with patches that will give faster start up of the nfs services.

			LibreOffice 4.2.3 is the newest version available and it’s also a Final (Stable) release, which means you can rely on it not crashing and compromising your precious data.

			<h1 class="titlePage">Software Medium</h1>
			<p>
			<span style="color: #003399; font-weight: 600;">- Contrib</span>: Recently a new contributor to OpenMandriva has placed some interesting packages in our Contrib repository a few examples are xt7-player, the lightest gui for mplayer and Bino which allows you play with 3d movies if you have the technology (Red and Green lensed glasses :) ). The Contrib repository is gradually being updated and rebuilt but this is a major task and will take some time.
			</p>
			<p>
			<span style="color: #003399; font-weight: 600;">- Restricted</span>:This is where non free libraries that aren't installed by default are kept. For example, playing mp4 videos with VLC needs libfaad2_2 which can be installed after having added all set of media. You will also find in this repository some of the famous PLF builds which enable additional functionality to some programs not included in the main release repositories.
